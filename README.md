# SRCNN_Cpp.VS2013
VS2013 Implementation of Image Super-Resolution using Convolutional Neural Network

### Introduction
**SRCNN_Cpp.VS2012** is a VC++2013 Implementation of Image Super-Resolution using SRCNN which is proposed by Chao Dong in 2014.
 - If you want to find the details of SRCNN algorithm, please read the paper:  

   Chao Dong, Chen Change Loy, Kaiming He, Xiaoou Tang. Learning a Deep Convolutional Network for Image Super-Resolution, in Proceedings of European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014
 - If you want to download the training code(caffe) or test code(Matlab) for SRCNN, please open your browse and visit http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/SRCNN.html for more details.
 - And thank you very much for Chao's work in SRCNN.

### License
SRCNN_Cpp.VS2013 is released under the GPL v2 License (refer to the LICENSE file for details).

### Contents
1. [Requirements](#requirements)
2. [Demo](#demo)

### Requirements

1. You need to install *OpenCV2+* or *OpenCV3+* in your computer.

   OpenCV download site: http://opencv.org/

2. You also need to install Visual Studio in your system.

**Note:** Our *SRCNN_Cpp.VS2013* is developed in Windows 10 x64 system with OpenCV 3.0.0 and Visual Studio 2013.

### Demo

1. SRCNN-CPP1.0 is a *IplImage* Version Software which will run faster.

2. SRCNN-CPP2.0 is a *Mat* Version Software which will run slower.

3. You can just open the .sln file using Visual Studio and build.
